// Per-item merge for diary items and water entries (Option C, 2026-08-11).
//
// Prior behavior: PUT /api/diary/:date and POST /api/sync/push replaced the
// row's items and water arrays wholesale. Any client whose local copy had
// gone stale (mobile SQLite reset, cache truncated, race with a concurrent
// write) would push its empty or truncated list and silently wipe the
// server's real data. See project_nutritrace_diary_persist_gap for the
// 2026-07-23 and 2026-08-11 incidents that motivated this module.
//
// New behavior: every item and every water entry has a client-generated
// uuid. Deletions are represented as explicit tombstones on both wire
// (deleted_uuids on write) and disk (diary_tombstones table). The server
// merges rather than replaces:
//
//   - Server items whose uuid is NOT in the client's list AND NOT in
//     the client's deleted_uuids are PRESERVED. This is the safe default
//     that eliminates the wholesale-wipe bug.
//   - Server items whose uuid IS in a tombstone (existing or new) are
//     DROPPED.
//   - Client items whose uuid is new to the server are ADDED.
//   - Client items whose uuid matches an existing server item are treated
//     as an update: whichever side has the later updatedAt / addedAt wins.
//
// Deletion is destructive: a tombstone on either side beats a live copy on
// the other side. Consistent with how virtually every sync system resolves
// edit-vs-delete races.
//
// All functions here are pure (no db, no I/O). Callers wire in the current
// server state, the incoming client payload, and any prior tombstones, and
// get back a merged array plus the new tombstones to persist.
